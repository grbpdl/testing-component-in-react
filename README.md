Task 2: Implement and Test a React Component with API Integration


Objective:
Create a React component that fetches and displays data from an API, and write tests to ensure its correctness.


Requirements:
Data Fetching Component: Implement a React component that fetches a list of users from a public API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays the user names in a list.


Error Handling: Add basic error handling to the component, displaying an error message if the API request fails.


Testing with Jest and React Testing Library:
Write unit tests to ensure that the component renders correctly when data is fetched successfully.
Mock the API request and test how the component handles loading states and errors.
Test that the error message is displayed when the API call fails.
